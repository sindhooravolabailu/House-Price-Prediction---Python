# House-Price-Prediction---Python and Machine Learning

## Project Overview:
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:
I've meticulously cleaned the dataset, performed feature engineering, and applied necessary transformations to enhance the quality of the data for modeling.

- Algorithm Exploration:
Explored a range of machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), and Ensemble methods, employing hyperparameter tuning to optimize their performance.

- Top Performing Algorithms:
After thorough experimentation, the Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms emerged as the top performers, showcasing superior predictive capabilities.

- XGBoost Dominance:
Notably, XGBoost outperformed all other algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex relationships within the dataset.
